.SH NAME
fw1-loggrabber \- a command line LEA-client for Checkpoint FW-1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fw1-loggrabber [--options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fw1-loggrabber
is a commandline LEA client is a command-line LEA-client for Checkpoint FW-1. 
Using this tool, it's possible to get FW-1 logging data from remote using
Checkpoints proprietary LEA protocol, which is a part of their OPSEC API. 
The idea for \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR was born due to the need of analysing 
Checkpoint FW-1 log data using LIRE (http://www.logreport.org). Meanwhile
their are a lot of additional features, which hopefully ease daily work
of many firewall administrators.
.SH PREREQUISITES

.SH OPTIONS
In the following lines, all available command line options are described in detail. Most
of the options can also be configured using the configuration file \fBfw1-loggrabber.conf\fR
(see \fB--configfile\fR option to use a different configuration file). The precedence of given
options is as follows: commandline, configuration file, default value. E.g. if you set the 
resolve-mode to be used in the configuration file, this can be overwritten by 
commandline option \fB--noresolve\fR. Only if an option isn't set neither on commandline nor in
the configuration file, the default value will be used.
.TP 
.B -p <portnumber>, --port <portnumber> [OBSOLETE]
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.TP
.B -s <servername>, --server <servername> [OBSOLETE]
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.TP 
.B -f <logfilename|pattern|ALL>, --logfile <logfilename|pattern>
With these parameters, the name of the FW-1 logfile to be read, can be specified. This
can be either done exactly or using only a part of the filename. If no exact match can
be found in the list of logfiles returned by the FW-1 management station, all logfiles
which contain the specified string are processed. A special case is the usage of \fBALL\fR
instead of a logfile name or pattern. In that case all logfiles that are available
on the management station, will be processed. If this parameter is omitted, only the default
logfile fw.log will be processed. E.g.
.RS

--logfile 2003-03-27_213652.log
.RE
.RS
--logfile 2003-03
.RE
.RS

The first example display the logfile 2003-03-27_213652.log, the second one processes
all logfiles which contain 2003-03 in their filename.
.RE
.TP
.B -c <configfilename>, --configfile <configfilename>
These options allow to specify a non-default configuration file, in which most
of the commandline options can be configured as well as other options, which are
not available as commandline parameters. If this parameter is omitted, the file 
\fBfw1-loggrabber.conf\fR in the current directory will be used. See below for a
description of all available configuration file options.
.TP
.B -l <leaconfigfilename>, --leaconfigfile <leaconfigfilename>
Using one of these options, it's possible to use a non-default LEA configuration
file. In this file, all connection parameters such as FW-1 server, port, authentication
method as well as sic names have to be configured. That's the usual configuration 
procedure for OPSEC applications. If this parameter is omitted, the file
\fBlea.conf\fR in the current directory will be used. See below for a description
of all available LEA configuration file options.
.TP
.B --resolve
Using the \fB--resolve\fR option, IP addresses will be resolved to names using 
FW-1 name resolving behaviour. This resolving mechanism will not cause the machine
running \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR to initiate DNS requests, but the name resolution will
be done directly on the FW-1 machine. Enabled name resolution is also the default 
behaviour of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR.
.TP
.B --noresolve
In contrast to \fB--resolve\fR, the option \fB--no-resolve\fR will cause IP addresses
to be displayed in log output instead of names.
.TP
.B --showfiles
The option \fB--showfiles\fR can be used to simply show the available logfiles on
the FW-1 management station. After the names of the logfiles have been displayed,
\fBfw1-loggrabber\fR quits.
.TP
.B --showlogs
The default behaviour of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR is to 
display the content of the logfiles and not just their names. This can be explicitely
specified using the \fB--showlogs\fR option.
.TP
.B --auth [OBSOLETE]   
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.TP
.B --no-auth [OBSOLETE]
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.TP
.B --2000
The option \fB--2000\fR has to be used if you want to connect to CP FW-1 4.1 (2000) 
firewalls. You have to consider, that some options are not available for non-NG 
firewalls. These include \fB--auth\fR, \fB--showfiles\fR, \fB--auditlog\fR and 
some other options.
.TP
.B --ng
The default FW-1 version, for which this tool is being developed, is CP FW-1 5.0 (NG), 
which is the default version, is no version is explicitely specified.
.TP
.B --online
Using online mode, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR starts output of logging data at the end of 
the specified logfile (or fw.log if no logfilename has been specified). All future 
log entries will be displayed. If you use \fB--logfile\fR to specify another logfile
to be processed, you have to consider that no data will be shown, if the file isn't
active anymore. This mode is mainly used for continuously processing FW-1 log data 
and continues to display log entries also after scheduled and manual log switches.
.TP
.B --no-online
In contrast to online mode, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR quits after having displayed the last
log entry, when running in offline mode. This is the default behaviour and is mainly
used for analysis of historic log data.
.TP
.B --auditlog
Using the audit mode, content of the audit logfile (fw.adtlog) can be displayed. This 
includes administrator actions and uses different fields than normal log data.
.TP
.B --normallog
The default mode of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR processes normal FW-1 logfiles. In contrast 
to the \fB--auditlog\fR option, no admistration actions are displayed in this mode, but
all regular log data.
.TP
.B --filter \*(lq<filterexpression1>[;<filterexpression2>]\*(rq
Using one or multiple \fB--filter\fR options, you are able to filter log entries in 
order to see only entries which match your filter rules. You can specify multiple 
filter rules using multiple \fB--filter\fR options. All filter rules are related by
OR, i.e. if you specify multiple rules, a log entry will be displayed if one of the
rules matches. Within one filter rule, you can specify multiple arguments. All of these
arguments are related by AND, i.e. a single filter rule only matches a given log entry
if the log entry is matched by all arguments. A more detailed description of filter rules
you can find below in a separate chapter about filtering which also provides various examples.
.TP
.B --fields \*(lq<field1>[;<field2>]\*(rq
The \fB--fields\fR option can be used to display only a given set of fields
instead of displaying all available fields. The order of the fields being displayed is
the same as specified within the \fB--fields\fR option. E.g.
.RS

--fields "loc;src;dst"
.RE
.RS

You can display the currently supported fields with the \fB--help-fields\fR option.
If you are missing some fields, please run \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR with \fB--debug-level 1\fR 
and check for debug output containing \fI"Unsupported field found: fieldname=fieldvalue"\fR.
If you send me these lines I will implement the missing fields in the next release.
.RE
.TP
.B --fieldnames
Using the \fB--fieldnames\fR option the name of each field will be prepended to
each value in each line of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR output. E.g.  
.RS
 
loc=42|src=1.2.3.4|dst=4.3.2.1 
.RE
.TP
.B --nofieldnames
In contrast to the \fB--fieldnames\fR option, the usage of this option will cause
fieldnames to be displayed in the first line of output only. All the following output
lines contain only the fieldvalues separated by '|' or by a user defined separator. E.g.
.RS

loc|src|dst
.RE
.RS
42|1.2.3.4|4.3.2.1
.RE
.TP
.B --create-tables
This option just creates the \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR tables in the database referenced
by configuration file parameter \fBODBC_DSN\fR. If one or more of the tables already
exist, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR prompts for dropping and recreating the tables. 
\fBfw1-loggrabber\fR only creates tables and no additional indexes on certain columns.
If you need these, please create the indexes by yourself using your DBMS management
software.
At the moment, the following DBMS are supported and tested: MySQL (v4.0), PostgreSQL (v7.3), 
IBM DB2 (v8.1), Oracle (v8) and MS SQL Server (v2000). If you can verify \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR
to be working with other versions of these DBMS, please tell me about this.
.TP
.B --debuglevel <0-3>
Sets the debuglevel to the specified value. A debuglevel of 0 means no output of
debug informations. Further debuglevels will cause output of program specific as well
as OPSEC specific debug informations.
.TP
.B --help
Use \fB--help\fR to display basic help and usage information. For further help, please
refer to the man page.
.TP
.B --help-fields
This option just displays all fieldnames which are currently supported by 
\fBfw1-loggrabber\fR for both normal logfiles and audit logfiles.
.SH LEA CONFIGURATION FILE
Starting with version 1.11, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR uses the default connection configuration 
procedure for OPSEC applications. This includes server, port and authentication settings.
From now on, all this parameters can only be configured using the configuration file 
\fBlea.conf\fR (see \fB--leaconfigfile\fR option to use a different LEA configuration
file) and not using the command-line as before.
.TP
.B lea_server ip <IP address>
This parameter specifies the IP address of the FW1 management station, to which 
\fBfw1-loggrabber\fR should connect to.
.TP
.B lea_server port <port number>
The port on the FW1 management station, to which \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR should connect to,
can be specified using this option. If you want to use authenticated connections to 
your firewall, you have to use \fBlea_server auth_port\fR instead.
.TP
.B lea_server auth_port <port number>
In contrast to the previous option, this one has to be used for specifying the port 
to be used for authenticated connection to your FW1 management station.
.TP
.B lea_server auth_type <authentication mechanism>
If you want to use authenticated connections to your FW1 management station, you
can use this parameter to specify the authentication mechnismn to be used. If this
parameter is omitted, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR defaults to \fBsslca\fR. Supported values
in this field are: sslca, sslca_clear, sslca_comp, sslca_rc4, sslca_rc4_comp,
asym_sslca, asym_sslca_comp, asym_sslca_rc4, asym_sslca_rc4_comp, ssl, ssl_opsec,
ssl_clear, ssl_clear_opsec, fwn1 and auth_opsec. 
.TP
.B opsec_sslca_file <p12-file>
When using authenticated connections, this parameter has to be used in order to 
specify the location of the PKCS#12 certificate.
.TP
.B opsec_sic_name "<SIC name of LEA-client>"
This parameter is also only necessary when using authenticated connections. 
In that case the SIC name of the LEA-client has to be specified using this parameter.
.TP
.B lea_server opsec_entity_sic_name "<SIC name of LEA-server>"
Similar to \fBopsec_sic_name\fR you have to specify the SIC name of your FW1
management station using this parameter when using authenticated connections..
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
This paragraph deals with the options that can be set within the configuration file.
The default configuration file is \fBfw1-loggrabber.conf\fR which should be in the 
current directory. (see \fB--configfile\fR option to use a different configuration file). 
The precedence of given
options is as follows: commandline, configuration file, default value. E.g. if you set the 
resolve-mode to be used in the configuration file, this can be overwritten by 
commandline option \fB--noresolve\fR. Only if an option isn't set neither on commandline nor in
the configuration file, the default value will be used.
.TP
.B DEBUG_LEVEL=<0-3>
Sets the debuglevel to the specified value. A debuglevel of 0 means no output of
debug informations. Further debuglevels will cause output of program specific as well
as OPSEC specific debug informations. This parameter can be overwritten by 
\fB--debug-level\fR command-line option.
.TP
.B FW1_SERVER=<IP address of FW1-Management Station> [OBSOLETE]
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.TP
.B FW1_PORT=<Port number for LEA connections> [OBSOLETE]
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.TP
.B FW1_LOGFILE=<Name of FW1-Logfilename>
With this parameter, the name of the FW-1 logfile to be read, can be specified. This
can be either done exactly or using only a part of the filename. If no exact match can
be found in the list of logfiles returned by the FW-1 management station, all logfiles
which contain the specified string are processed. If this parameter is omitted, the default
logfile fw.log will be processed.
The correspondent command-line parameter is \fB--logfile\fR.
.TP
.B FW1_OUTPUT=<files|logs>
This parameter simply specifies whether \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR should only display the 
available logfiles (files) on the FW-1 server or display the content of the logfiles (logs).
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--showfiles\fR and \fB--showlogs\fR.
.TP
.B FW1_TYPE=<ng|2000>
Using this parameter you can choose to which version of FW-1 to connect to. For Checkpoint
FW-1 5.0 (NG) you have to specify NG and for Checkpoint FW-1 4.1 (2000) you have to specify 2000.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--2000\fR and \fB--ng\fR.
.TP
.B FW1_MODE=<audit|normal>
This parameter enables you to specify whether to display audit logs which contain 
administrative actions of normal security logs, which contain data about dropped and 
accepted connections.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--auditlog\fR and \fB--normallog\fR.
.TP
.B ONLINE_MODE=<yes|no>
Using online mode, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR starts output of logging data at the end of 
the specified logfile (or fw.log if no logfilename has been specified). All future 
log entries will be displayed. If you use \fB--logfile\fR to specify another logfile
to be processed, you have to consider that no data will be shown, if the file isn't
active anymore. This mode is mainly used for continuously processing FW-1 log data.
If you disable online mode, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR quits after having displayed the last
log entry. This is the default behaviour and is mainly
used for analysis of historic log data.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--online\fR and \fB--no-online\fR.
.TP
.B RESOLVE_MODE=<yes|no>
With this option, IP addresses will be resolved to names using 
FW-1 name resolving behaviour. This resolving mechanism will not cause the machine
running \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR to initiate DNS requests, but the name resolution will
be done directly on the FW-1 machine. Enabled name resolution is also the default 
behaviour of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR.
If you disable resolving mode this will cause IP addresses
to be displayed in log output instead of names.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--resolve\fR and \fB--no-resolve\fR.
.TP
.B SHOW_FIELDNAMES=<yes|no>
Using this option can be chosen, whether the name of each field should be displayed i
in each line of log output (YES) of just in the first line of output.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--fieldnames\fR and \fB--nofieldnames\fR.
.TP
.B RECORD_SEPARATOR=<char>
This parameter can be used to change the default record separator (|) into another character.
If you choose a character which is contained in some log data, the occurrence within the 
logdata will be escaped by a backslash.
.TP
.B DATEFORMAT=<CP|UNIX|STD>
Using the \fBDATEFORMAT\fR option, you can choose between three different date formats 
for output of date fields. The value \fBCP\fR provides the standard Checkpoing date
format ( 3Feb2004 14:15:16). Using the values \fBUNIX\fR or \fBSTD\fR you can change 
this into standard Unix time format (1051655431) or into a standardized human-readable
format (2004-02-03 14:15:16).
.TP
.B LOGGING_CONFIGURATION=<screen|file|syslog|odbc>
The \fBLOGGING_CONFIGURATION\fR parameter can be used for redirection of logging output to
other destinations than the default destination STDOUT, i.e. screen. Currently it's possible
to redirect output to a file or to syslog daemon (Unix only). Using the parametes 
\fBOUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX\fR and \fBOUTPUT_FILE_ROTATESIZE\fR, you can specify more details,
if you choose to redirect the output to a file. If you have chosen \fBODBC\fR, you have to
specify the DSN in the parameter \fBODBC_DSN\fR.
.TP
.B OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX=<prefix of output file>
This parameter can be used to define a prefix for the output filename. Eventually the output 
file will get the suffix \fB.log\fR respectively a datestamp when it gets rotated. The
default value for this prefix is simply \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR. This parameter will only be 
used if \fBLOGGING_CONFIGURATION\fR is set to \fBfile\fR.
.TP
.B OUTPUT_FILE_ROTATESIZE=<rotatesize in bytes>
Using this parameter you can specify the maximum size of the output files, before they will
be rotated. If the size of the output file exceeds the given value, the logfile will be rotated
to <OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX>-YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss[-x].log. The default value is 1048576 bytes, 
which equals 1 megabyte. It should be obvious
that this parameter will only be used if \fBLOGGING_CONFIGURATION\fR is set to \fBfile\fR.
.TP
.B ODBC_DSN=<ODBC Database DSN>
This parameter has to be used to specify the ODBC-DSN of your database. The DSN will only 
be used when \fBLOGGING_CONFIGURATION\fR is set to \fBODBC\fR.
.TP
.B SYSLOG_FACILITY=<USER|LOCAL0|...|LOCAL7>
This parameter can be used to set the syslog facility to be used (Unix only). 
Obviously this is only effective when running \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR with 
\fBLOGGING_CONFIGURATION=SYSLOG\fR.
.TP
.B AUTHENTICATED=<yes|no> [OBSOLETE]
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.TP
.B AUTHENTICATION_TYPE=<authtype value> [OBSOLETE]
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.TP
.B OPSEC_CERTIFICATE=<Path and Name of Opsec Certificate> [OBSOLETE]
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.TP
.B OPSEC_CLIENT_DN=<DN of Opsec-Client> [OBSOLETE]
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.TP
.B OPSEC_SERVER_DN=<DN of Opsec-Server> [OBSOLETE]
This option is obsolete starting from version 1.11. The connection configuration
has to be done using the LEA configuration file. Please read the paragraph 
\fBLEA CONFIGURATION FILE\fR for further description of available parameters.
.SH CONFIGURE FW-1

.SH FILTERING
Filter rules provide the possibility to display only log entries that
match a given set of rules. There can be specified one or more filter 
rules using one or multiple \fB--filter\fR arguments on the command 
line. All individual filter rules are related by OR. That means a log
entry will be displayed if at least one of the filter rules matches.
Within one filter rule, there can be specified multiple arguments. All 
these arguments are related by AND. That means a filter rule matches a
given log entry only, if all of the filter arguments match.
.TP

.TP
.B Negation of arguments
If you specify '!=' instead of '=' between name and value
of the filter argument, you can negate the name/value pair.
.TP
.B Specifying multiple argument values
You can specify multiple argument values by separating the
values by ','.
.TP
.B Specifying IP addresses as argument values
For arguments that expect IP addresses, you can specify either
a single IP address, multiple IP addresses separated by ',' or
a network address with netmask (e.g. 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0). Currently
it's not possible to specify a network address and a single IP
address within the same filter argument.
.TP
.B Specifying multiple filter arguments
Each filter rule can exist of multiple filter arguments which have
to be separated by ';'.
